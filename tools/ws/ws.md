The Maniaplanet Web Services is the public API that everyone can use to retrieve various information about the game, the players, the rankings, etc. You can use that API to build all sorts of applications.

*You can get help on the [ManiaPlanet Web Services forum](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewforum.php?f=282).*
